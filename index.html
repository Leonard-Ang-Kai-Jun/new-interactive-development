          <p> This is me, Leonard Ang Kai Jun, student no. S10223546F of Ngee Ann Polytechnic here. My birthday is on 19 October 2002, born at Gleneagles Hospital Singapore. From 2009 to 2020, I was a student of Pathlight School that suffered from autism disorders. Some of my interesting hobbies I like and done are watching YouTube videos, playing games, browsing the web, knowing about operating systems and web browsers, and chatting with my friends on various social media platforms. </p>

            <p> These are some of my social media websites that I use everyday: YouTube, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Instagram. For YouTube, I watch various videos of my interests such as BRIGHT SIDE and Meet Arnold in different languages E.g. English, French, German, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese etc. For the other 3, I use them solely for online communication with my ex-schoolmates from Pathlight and my current schoolmates from Ngee Ann Polytechnic. </p>

          <p> These are some of the web browsers I use in my everyday life, including Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera. I'm also fascinated by that there are lots of different browsers besides those, knowing them since 2013. I use them to play games, browse the web, watch videos on YouTube, etc. </p>

        <div class = 'computing-text-2'>
          <p> I use the computer and phone everyday, and both need an operating system to functionalize. I'm also fascinated by that there are lots of different operating systems such as Windows, Mac OS, Linux, Android, and iOS. I'm even more fascinated by a variety of Linux distributions and desktop environments there is. </p>
