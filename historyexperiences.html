          <p> As mentioned in my first page (Introduction and Personal Interests), I was born on the 19th of October 2002 at Gleneagles Hospital Singapore. I'm the youngest of a family of 2 with 1 older sister and I'm male. Of my history, I was admitted into Ichiban Nurtureland Kindergarten from 2005-2008 and Pathlight School from 2009-2020. Now, I'm currently studying Immersive Media at Ngee Ann Polytechnic in the School of ICT due to my computing and technology interests as I'm preparing my skills for my future workforce. </p>

        <p> 2005-2008:
          During my Nursery and Kindergarten years, I was admitted into Ichiban Nurtureland Kindergarten @ Choa Chu Kang. Here I learnt some basic English and Chinese language skills but struggled over the latter. I couldn't think and interact properly with my schoolmates that time as I have contracted autism when I was young, and by that the Chinese language was too difficult for me.</p>

        <p> 2009-2020:
        As a result of my autism disorders and inability to cope with Mother Tongue well (Chinese in my case), I was posted into a Special Education (SPED) school known as Pathlight School during my Primary and Secondary years. It has the usual MOE Primary and Secondary school syllabus, except for Mother Tongue, which is replaced by special life skills lessons. I took PSLE in 2015, all Standard subjects, with a PSLE score of 195. I then took the whole Express course in Secondary leading to my O-Levels in 2020 though I'm quite weak in English and Humanities, with a score of 18. </p>

        <p> 2021 Onwards:
        I'm now currently studying in Immersive Media in Ngee Ann Polytechnic, which is my course posted under the Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE). But, I had to take an English Language Express (ELE) course due to my weak English results during my O-Levels. Nonetheless, I will be graduating from Ngee Ann Poly in 2024 and receive my diploma before heading over to University for the final stage of studying before I get my future job as a technological one because it's considered as IT. </p>
